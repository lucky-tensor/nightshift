## Terms and Conditions

This license grants rights to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software
("Software") under the following tiered terms based on your usage category.

---

### 1. Researchers and Individual End Users

If you are an individual using this Software for personal, educational, or
non-commercial research purposes, you may use, copy, modify, and distribute
this Software under either of the following licenses at your choice:

- **Apache License 2.0** (https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
- **MIT License** (https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

---

### 2. Business Users with Open Source Operations

If you are a business entity that releases its primary operational software
as open source under an OSI-approved license, you may use this Software under
the same license you apply to your own software.

**Requirements:**
- Your operational software must be publicly available under an OSI-approved
  open source license (e.g., Apache 2.0, MIT, GPL, MPL).
- The open source release must represent genuine operational software, not
  token or trivial projects created solely to qualify under this provision.
- Upon request, you must provide evidence of your qualifying open source
  software to the licensor.

**Effect:** If you license your software under Apache 2.0, you may use this
Software under Apache 2.0. If you use MIT, this Software is available to you
under MIT, and so forth.

---

### 3. Business Users without Open Source Operations

If you are a business entity that does not meet the criteria in Section 2
(i.e., you do not release your primary operational software as open source),
this Software is licensed to you under the terms of the **Business Source
License 1.1** (BSL) with the following parameters:

- **Change Date:** Four (4) years from the date of each release
- **Change License:** Apache License 2.0
- **Additional Use Grant:** None

Under BSL terms, you may view, modify, and use the Software internally, but
production use requires a commercial license from the licensor until the
Change Date, at which point it converts to Apache 2.0.

---

### 4. General Provisions

- **No Warranty:** This Software is provided "as is" without warranty of any
  kind, express or implied.
- **Limitation of Liability:** In no event shall the authors be liable for
  any damages arising from use of this Software.
- **Governing Interpretation:** If ambiguity exists regarding your usage
  category, the licensor reserves the right to make a determination.
