# Prototypes Quick Start

## Overview

This directory serves as a sandbox for experimental features and proofs-of-concept. Code here is not production-ready but informs the architecture in `src/`.

## Active Prototypes

- **`diff-brain/`**: Experiments with git diff analysis and patch application.
- **`blackboard/`**: Shared state management experiments for multi-agent systems.
- **`multi-agent/`**: Prototypes for agent coordination and message passing.
- **`code-index/`**: Experiments with code search and AST indexing.
